C Intro Lab Demonstration
==============
These are some program files I made for my xxxx *** Lab. I'm commiting these because I think that these may be educational, and also demonstrate my work on myself as I try to learn C and systems-level programming. 

**Don't use this for your own lab** - this is just for demonstration purposes and educational reference on basic C programs. I would *strongly* recommend learning C on your own. These are just examples, and will not apply to your lab.
