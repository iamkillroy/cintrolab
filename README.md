EECS 388 Lab 1
==============
These are some program files I made for my EECS 388 Lab. I'm commiting these because I think that these may be educational, and also demonstrate my work on myself as I try to learn C and systems-level programming.

**Don't use this for your own lab** - this is just for demonstration purposes and educational reference on basic C programs. I would *strongly* recommend learning C on your own.
